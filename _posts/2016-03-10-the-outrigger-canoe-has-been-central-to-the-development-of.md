In Hawaiian tradition each canoe is a living entity, with its own spiritual power or _mana_. We entrust our lives to our canoes and we treat them with respect.

The open-ocean conditions surrounding our islands led to the development of an outrigger canoe different from those of other Pacific islanders. The Hawaiian outrigger is relatively unadorned, with fore and aft hull covers (kupe) and a splashguard (pale kai) to cope with ocean waves and chop.

Although outriggers now are raced throughout Polynesia, outrigger canoe racing, ancient and modern, seems to have originated in Hawai'i. There are records of ancient Hawaiians racing for fun and for wagers, sometimes including life.
